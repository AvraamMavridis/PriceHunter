Functional specification:
Our web application will have two types of clients: the customer and the logistic manager of the
supermarket. The aim of the application is to give information to the customer about the
supermarket which has the lowest price corresponding to the demanded shopping list of the
customer. The customer creates a shopping list, the application calculates the sum price of the
products in each supermarket and orders the supermarkets based on
that price. In that way the customer is aware of the cheapest place from where to buy the items of his
shopping list (Optional: If an item from the shopping list of the customer is not available in the
supermarket, because for instance they do not sell the specific brand of the product, there is a
proposing list of similar products or inform the customer from where he can buy the product). The
customer created shopping list are saved in his account for later use. The logistics manager is
responsible to add/delete/modify the supermarket’s available products. Customer can use the web
application with or without creating an account, for the logistics manager is mandatory to create an
account. (Optional: We can provide to the logistics manager some statistics e.g. how many times his
supermarket win the arbitration, which of their products are more expensive against the
competition...)
